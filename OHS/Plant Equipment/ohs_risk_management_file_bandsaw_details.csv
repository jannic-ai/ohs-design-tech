PEM-EQ-CUT-001,Hazard Management Details – General - Description of Use,Description of Use:,"A band saw uses a vertical blade consisting of a continuous band of metal with teeth along one edge. Work pieces are hand fed onto the cutting edge. The band rides on two wheels rotating in the same plane. The band saw produces uniform cutting action as a result of an evenly distributed tooth load. Band saws can be used for woodworking, metal working, or for cutting a variety of other materials, and are particularly useful for cutting irregular or curved shapes, but can also be used to produce straight cuts.",,,,,,,2
